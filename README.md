Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit
Project Overview:
This project focuses on scraping bus travel data from the Redbus website with help of Selenium automation, storing it in a SQL database, and building an interactive web application using Streamlit for data analysis and filtering. It provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing key bus travel details, including routes, schedules, prices, star ratings, and seat availability.

Key Features:
Web Scraping: Automated extraction of bus travel data (e.g., routes, prices, availability) using Selenium.
Data Storage: Data stored in a structured SQL database.
Streamlit Application: Interactive application that enables users to filter and analyze bus data by various attributes.

Skills Takeaway:
Web Scraping (Selenium)
Python
Streamlit Web Application Development
SQL Database Management
Data Analysis

Project Approach:
1. Data Scraping:
Tool: Selenium
Source: Redbus
Data Collected: Routes, schedules, prices, seat availability, bus types (AC/Non-AC), departure and arrival times, star ratings.
2. Data Storage:
Database: SQL Database
Schema: A structured table for storing bus travel data with necessary fields such as route name, bus type, departing time, etc.
3. Streamlit Application:
Filters: Users can filter data by route, bus type (Sleeper/Seater/AC/Non-AC), price, star rating, and seat availability.
Data Analysis: The app provides tools for analyzing and visualizing data (e.g., average price per route, availability trends).
